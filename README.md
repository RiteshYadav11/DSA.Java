# DSA.java Project

Welcome to the DSA.java project! This repository contains various data structures and algorithms (DSA) implementations and practice problems. The focus of this project is on learning and implementing fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms using Java.

## Topics Covered

1. **Array**
   - Implementation and usage of arrays
   - Common operations on arrays (insertion, deletion, searching, etc.)
   
2. **2D Array**
   - Implementation and manipulation of 2D arrays
   - Common operations on 2D arrays (traversal, searching, etc.)

3. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Radix Sort
   - Bucket Sort
   - Other sorting techniques

4. **Recursion**
   - Understanding recursion
   - Common recursive problems and solutions
   - Backtracking problems

5. **String Manipulation**
   - Basic string operations
   - Pattern matching
   - String algorithms

## Practice Files

This repository also includes various practice files and problems to help reinforce the concepts learned in each topic. These practice files provide hands-on experience and are a great way to test your understanding.
